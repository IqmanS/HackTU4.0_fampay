***FamPay Problem Statement Track 1***

  <p>
  Unleash your tech wizardry and make FamPay the reigning monarch of campus payments! ðŸ‘‘ FamPay is the leading app for teenagers to do payments, we now need to hack campuses and get FamPay to be the undisputed ruler of all transactions on campus.
Let's say goodbye to juggling between multiple payment apps and introduce hassle-free transactions with FamPay.
Put on your thinking caps and dream up a unique and innovative solution ( a web app, mobile app, a game, anything!) to make FamPay the one and only payment app on campus.

<h1>Problem we tried to solve</h1>

<p> In an already clustered market where online payments UPI app such as paytm,phonePe,GPay have well established name FamPay wants to target India's future the teenagers and to do say needs something creative that gives a statement yet simple that doesn't make it complicated to understand.

**Our Idea 1**

we already know how wallet and UPI payment are too quick and hassle free that many time we forget when we spend so much money so just like how phone has a low battery change of color in alert system we tried to change theme of the app on the basis of the balance one has over the month. 


Let us say at the start of month you have â‚¹5000 in your bank as your avg balance

then two weeks later you spent â‚¹4200 and only have â‚¹800 as balance left which is low so your app theme will shift to red indicating you have low balance and that you should check your balance.

Now after the alert you controlled your budget and by end of month you again got money and now your balance has reached â‚¹6000 which is more than your average amount so your theme will again change to Green.
